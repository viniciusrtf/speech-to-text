# whisper
Experiments with speech-to-text using local OpenAI Whisper v2 model. 
The goal is to achieve a decent tool to speed up LLMs prompting and human-computer interaction as a whole via speech commands.

# Disclaimer
I don't know Python at all (my thing is Golang) and this code is almost entirely generated by GPT-4. Expect bugs, glitches and issues.
